# Task Note

## Description
For this weeks lesson we had to use express and heroku to setup our first server and live website. We did this by implementing what we've learned this week in Module 11
Task Note is a simple note taking app that allows you to save and delete your notes by parsing it through a database. At least that's my current understanding of what we're doing.
